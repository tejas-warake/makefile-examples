### Makefiles
> Makefiles follow the following syntax
```
target: prerequisites
  command 1
  command 2
  command 3
  ...
  ...
```

- Prerequisites are the files which are used for target to execute.
- target is the command name which we provide along with make command like "make all".
- With indentation we specify the commands in order to build the target.
